## Requirements
- MATLAB (R2020a or later recommended)
- Deep Learning Toolbox
- Pre-trained models (AlexNet, GoogLeNet)
- **Food-11 Dataset**: Download and unzip into your workspace.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/miikeydev/Food-Image-Classification.git
   cd Food-Image-Classification
   
2. Place the unzipped Food-11 dataset in your workspace.
3. Install pre-trained models via MATLAB's Add-On Explorer

4. You can run the scripts :)
